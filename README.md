# Synthy by Evan Escobar
Music toy and instrument app using AudioKit v5

This is a simple synth app that is built using Swift in Xcode 14.3 and AudioKit v5. 

The app uses 4 groups of 4 oscillators - one sine wave oscillator that always plays the desired frequency, but an octave lower, two triangle oscillators that play the desired frequency or an adjusted frequency that depends on the original, and one fm oscillator that functions like the triangle oscillators. Four groups allows four different notes to be played at the same time, with each note having the richness of four oscillators. 

The app features an interface that allows users to see the 7 notes of a musical scale and allows the user to change various aspects of the oscillators, including amplitude envelope and scale modes. 

Thus, the app is a nice blend of digital synthesis, music theory, and design. 

The app was programmed by me, Evan Escobar, in June 2023. However, Stack Overflow was a fantastic resource and provided many valuable answers.
